The `uart_tx` contains a variable `x_factor` which changes to 1, whenever the `data_in` variable is changed. This `x_factor` is used to `handle`/`or start` a new transmission whenever the `data_in` is changed without being concerned by the non-synchronization of the `Tx_Drive` variable with the `tick` variable of the system.
